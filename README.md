# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


This project is a modern web application built with React and styled using Tailwind CSS. It has a responsive design, reusable components, and a streamlined development process with Vite. Tailwind CSS ensures rapid UI development with utility-first styling, and React creates dynamic and interactive components.
